# CLAUDE.md

This repository uses `AGENTS.md` as the single source of collaboration rules.

## Required startup steps

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.
3. For provider changes, also read `docs/PROVIDER_INTEGRATION.md`.
4. For security/storage changes, also read `docs/SECURITY_POLICY.md`.

Do not duplicate or fork rules here; update `AGENTS.md` instead.
