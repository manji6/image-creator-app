# CODEX.md

This repository uses `AGENTS.md` as the canonical rule set for coding agents.

## Required startup steps

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.
3. Read domain-specific docs based on task scope:
   - Provider work: `docs/PROVIDER_INTEGRATION.md`
   - Security/data work: `docs/SECURITY_POLICY.md`
   - Product behavior work: `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`

When behavior changes, update both tests and docs before completion.
